# DATA SCIENCE WEEK 2

The second week of my Practical Data Science teaching materials.

This week comprises:

- A practice on week 1's lecture on Python's libraries for Data Science, mostly focused on `pandas`.

- A lecture on webscraping, Regular Expressions and Data Cleanup

- And another lecture on Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**).

You'll need to install:

The same working environment, software and tools as in **Week 1**, if not installed.

From this week, if not specified, we will consider as working with the libraries/ software(s) or tool(s) as in **Week 1**.
